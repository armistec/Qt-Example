To begin, download ESRI App Studio desktop and check out some of the examples provided. This tutorial focuses on building an app starting from the Hello World (Runtime) App starter template. This tutorial steps through the process of adding serveral features to your app, enabling clear visualization of multiple feature layers. Focus is placed on two elements, changing the visibility of sublayers within a feature class and displaying a legend based on the features currently displayed on the map.

First, create a new App in ESRI App Studio. Then open the code associated with the app in QT Creater.

To begin building map elements, it is first important to add a basemap and chose the type of visualizaiton you would like.
